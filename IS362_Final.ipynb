    "For my final project I plan to demonstrate all that I have learned throughout the course. I will be using data from [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). Utilizing the available data, I have decided to use [311 Service Requests](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/311-Service-Requests-From-2015/57g5-etyj) for 2015. I have filtered the data to shorten the amount of wait time for results as the dat is very large. <br /><br /> With the available data I plan to show:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> What was the number #1 service request handled by 311 in 2015? </li>\n",
    "<li> What season received the most service requests? Name a few of the SRâ€™s </li>\n",
    "<li> What borough made the most service request in 2015? </li>\n",
    "<li> What was the total of service requests in 2015? </li>\n",
    "<li> How many service requests remain open? How many have been closed? </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "I plan to have a pie graph to display the seasons and possibly the borough with most service requests. I also plan to include some images <i>(if I can figure it out)</i> and some other types of graphs to display more info on service requests for 2015."
